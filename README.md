# Pokémon Simluator 
Pokémon Simluator is a game that implements Pokémon's battle system. The user battles against an opponent that uses a brute-force algorithm to choose its moves and it reacts appropriately to changes in the player's Pokemon. The program uses a JFrame and and JComponents to create the GUI and uses enums to organize the Pokémon types, status effects, categories of moves, etc.

The user can choose to have a quick battle where there are three random Pokémon on each team or a custom battle where the user can choose to have one to six Pokémon on each team and choose the Pokemon or have them randomly selected. In battle, the user can attack the opponent or switch Pokemon. Whenever one of the player's Pokemon faints, they can choose which Pokemon to send out. Attacks can also sometimes cause status effects, recoil, or self-fainting, depending on the move.
